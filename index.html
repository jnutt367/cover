  <h1>I'm Jason D. Nutt,</h1>
  <p>a passionate web developer 5 years into a mission to push the boundaries of technology and creativity.</p>
  <p>With a solid foundation in front-end web development from my tech degree at Treehouse, I've delved, dived, jumped....went way down into... deep into the world of web technologies.</p>
  <p>The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>

  <p>My journey has taken me through the intricacies of MongoDB and SQL, where I've honed my skills in database management.

    <p>Alongside, I've emersed myself and become well adept with the powerful realms of React and TypeScript during my postgraduate studies, expanding my toolkit for building dynamic, efficient web applications.</p>
    
    <p>Now, I'm driven to elevate my craft from experienced contractor/freelancer to professional developer extraordinaire.</p>
    
    <p>With a hunger for knowledge and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I'm constantly upskilling and refining my expertise to deliver innovative solutions that leave a lasting impact.</p>
    
    <p>I am actually building out a video series that is a walkthrough of the Next.js documentation, so that I can help those coming after me and also show it on my resume when I have that completed.</p>
    
    <p>Join me on this exhilarating journey as we push the boundaries of what's possible in web development!</p>
    
    <p>I hope to collaborate or work with you soon if we both find that it would be mutually beneficial!</p>

<div class="container mt-3">
    <h1>Keyboard Inputs</h1>
    <p>To indicate input that is typically entered via the keyboard, use the kbd element:</p>
    <p>Use <kbd>ctrl + p</kbd> to open the Print dialog box.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-3">
    <h1>Multiple Code Lines</h1>
    <p>For multiple lines of code, use the pre element:</p>
    <pre>
    Text in a pre element
    is displayed in a fixed-width
    font, and it preserves
    both      spaces and
    line breaks.
    </pre>
